## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - Ensure you've added the necessary permissions in `Info.plist`.
    - miniOS version - 13.0
      
2. **Launching the view**:
   - To display KinesteX, call `createWebView` in KinesteXAIFramework:

   ```Swift
    // isLoading is a State variable that can be used to display a loading screen before the webview loads
    KinesteXAIFramework.createWebView(apiKey: "your key", companyName: "your company", userId: "your userId", planCategory: .Cardio, workoutCategory: .Fitness, isLoading: $isLoading, onMessageReceived: { message in
                        // our callback function to let you know of any real-time changes and user activity
                        switch message {
                            
                        case .kinestexLaunched(let data):
                            print("KinesteX Launched: \(data)")
                        case .finishedWorkout(let data):
                            print("Workout Finished: \(data)")
                            // Handle other cases as needed
                        case .exitApp(let data):
                             // user wants to close KinesteX view, so dismiss the view
                            dismiss()
                        default:
                            break
                        }
                        
                    })

                       // OPTIONAL: Display loading screen
                      .overlay(
                        
                        Group {
                            if showAnimation {
                                 Text("Aifying workouts...").foregroundColor(.black).font(.caption)
                                    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity) // Fullscreen
                                    .background(Color.white) // White background
                                     .scaleEffect(showAnimation ? 1 : 3) // Scale up
                                    .opacity(showAnimation ? 1 : 0) // Fade out
                                    .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 1.5), value: showAnimation)
                                
                            }
                        }
                        
                        
                    )
                    // Smoothly hide the animation
                   .onChange(of: isLoading) { newValue in
                        if !newValue {
                            withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 2.5)) { // Extended duration to 2.5 seconds
                                showAnimation = false
                            }
                            
                        } else {
                            showAnimation = true
                        }
                    }
   
   ```

| `total_active_seconds` | Format: `number`   |   Logs every `5 seconds` and counts the number of active seconds a user has spent working out. This value is not sent when a user leaves camera tracking area  |
| `left_camera_frame` | Format: `number`  |  Indicates that a user has left the camera frame. The data sent is the current number of `total_active_seconds` |
| `returned_camera_frame` | Format: `number`  |  Indicates that a user has returned to the camera frame. The data sent is the current number of `total_active_seconds` |
| `workout_overview`    | Format:  `workout: string`,`total_time_spent: number`,  `total_repeats: number`, `total_calories: number`,  `percentage_completed: number`,  `total_mistakes: number`  |  Logged when a user finishes the workout with a complete short summary of the workout  |
| `exercise_overview`    | Format:  `[exercise_completed]` |  Returns a log of all exercises and their data (exercise_completed data is defined 5 lines above) |
| `workout_completed`    | Format:  `workout: string`, `date: dd mm yyyy hours:minutes:seconds`  |  Logs when a user finishes the workout and exits the workout overview |
| `active_days` (Coming soon)   | Format:  `number`  |  Represents a number of days a user has been opening KinesteX |
